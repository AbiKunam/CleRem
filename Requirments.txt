3)Sarah[SABARAGAMUVA Province-Kegalle]

*Process
-First I need to tell you that garbage vehicle doesn't come every place in a district in our area. It only come for cities and places near the city.
-When it  comes, it cames as garbage tractor or solid waste management vehicle.
-Also they collect waste as separation like, organic waste, non degradable waste, electric waste likewise. They strictly considering that.
-If people not waste there garbages as they said they would never bring those.
-Mostly they come to collect those 2 or 3 days per week. Anyway they cant collet all garbage within a day. Therefore, often they have divided the days of the week to collect 
 waste in different parts of the city.
-In our area they come 2 times per week as friday and sunday. Every week they don't come exactly that time,because of some cases the date will be change. But many time thats the thing.

*Complains
-Sometimes they didn't come exactly date . 
-Therefore it lead to overflowing bins and garbage piling up.
-Also improper disposal . Waste should be disposal in proper way. But sometimes we can see there is some lack of disposal things. 
 Then it lead to pollute the environment and pose health risks.

*Exepectation
-Mainly we hope an environmentally friendly waste collection process.
-Also,Timely collection is important . Waste should be collected regularly and on schedule to prevent overflows and littering.
-Waste separation is another thing. Ideally, there should be a system in place for residents to separate waste into categories like recyclables, compostables, and general waste.
-Another important thing is Proper disposal. Waste should be disposed of responsibly, without harming the environment or public health. This could involve recycling, composting, or
 safe incineration.
